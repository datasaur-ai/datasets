# BBC News Dataset

The BBC News Dataset is a set of text data that can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as text classification, text clustering, and more. In this repository, you will find a subset of the BBC News Dataset containing 250 news articles, both labeled and unlabeled. The labeled data is already labeled with categories such as business, entertainment, politics, sport, and tech, while the unlabeled data requires manual annotation.
